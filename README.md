## About the mod

This mod is supposed to be a sort of a minigame inside of minecraft. It is not supposed to be a mod with any kind of progression. All items added are not craftable in survival.

## About us - The developers

This mod is developed by a small team of coming professionals in the fields of programming, graphics- and sounddesign from germany. We are supported by some friends which help us build the maps.

Please keep in mind that we are not working on this project full time. In fact we will probably only be able to work on this project at weekends. So the **development might take a while**.
